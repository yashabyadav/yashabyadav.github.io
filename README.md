These are files for my website.

I am using [Codefolio](https://github.com/danielunited/codefolio) theme for Astro.

## Todo:
- [ ] Fix: Images not being loaded when importing a note from Obsidian vault
- [ ] Complete the projects page
    - [ ] Soft body simulation OSP (Computational physics course project)
    - [ ] Traction force from fluorescent cell images using UNets (Machine learning for Physicists course project)
### Minor fixes:
- [ ] Either change the way folders are displayed on the notes page or change the color of folder dropdown boxes from white to some shade of grey
