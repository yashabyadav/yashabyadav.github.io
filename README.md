# Portfolio

These are files for my website https://yashabyadav.github.io

I am using [Codefolio](https://github.com/danielunited/codefolio) theme for Astro.

## Todo:
- [ ] Complete the projects page
    - [ ] Soft body simulation OSP (Computational physics course project)
    - [x] Traction force from fluorescent cell images using UNets (Machine learning for Physicists course project)

- [ ] Remove all the files and scripts related to digital garden (started using Quartz for the digital garden instead)

- [ ] Put some graphics related to my work on the homepage on the background grid.

- [ ] Maybe the projects page need a sidebar as it is getting pretty long with multiple headings as I add content to it.

### Minor fixes:
