Formins are a diverse set of homodimers containing an IDR — the FH1 domain that facilitates polymerization of the cytoskeletal protein actin by increasing the local concentration of actin monomers at the actin assembly site.
 
A good explanation of Formin's role in actin polymerization:

#### The "Donut" (FH2 Domain)
The **FH2 domain** forms a stable, donut-shaped homodimer that acts as the "anchor". It performs two critical roles:
- **Nucleation:** It stabilizes the initial "seed" of actin monomers to start a new filament.
- **Processive Tracking:** It stays attached to the fast-growing "barbed end" of the filament as it grows, moving along with it without detaching.

The ==FH2 domain== of formins act as an anchor to the polymerizing actin filament.

Formins need to come together as a ==homodimer== at ==FH2 ==domins to be able to function as polymerization promoting factor of F-actin.

#### The "Grabby Arms" (FH1 Domain)

The **FH1 domains** are long, flexible, "intrinsically disordered" regions that extend from the FH2 anchor like long arms. They contain multiple **[proline-rich motifs (PRMs)](/notes/proline)**, which serve as binding sites for the protein **profilin** when it is bound to an actin monomer.

## Function
### Capture and Deliver
- **Capture Step:** The flexible FH1 arms reach into the surrounding solution to "grab" profilin-actin complexes using their PRM binding sites.
- **Delivery Step:** Once captured, the FH1 arm physically moves to bring the actin monomer to the FH2 domain. This increases the local concentration of actin at the assembly site, allowing the filament to grow much faster than it would through random diffusion alone.
