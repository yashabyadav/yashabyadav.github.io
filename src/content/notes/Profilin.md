Profilin prevents uncontrolled actin nucleation but **channels actin monomers into productive, barbed-end elongation**, especially in collaboration with nucleators like [Formins](/notes/formins) — essentially acting as a **gatekeeper and supplier** for actin polymerization.

### 1. Binding to actin monomers
- Profilin binds actin monomers (G-actin) in a **1:1 complex**, specifically at the **barbed-end side of actin**, preventing spontaneous nucleation.
- Because of this, profilin–actin complexes cannot nucleate new filaments on their own → this is the **inhibitory aspect**.

---

### 2. Promoting barbed-end elongation
- However, profilin–actin complexes can still be added to the **barbed ends of existing filaments** (but not the pointed ends).
- This accelerates elongation when barbed ends are available.
- The bound profilin dissociates upon incorporation, so actin remains in the filament.

### 3. Nucleotide exchange activity
- Profilin also acts as a **nucleotide exchange factor** for actin.
- It promotes the replacement of ADP with ATP/ADP+Pi in actin monomers.
- Since ATP-actin is the preferred substrate for polymerization, this increases the pool of polymerization-competent actin.

### 4. Interaction with pro-polymerization factors

- Profilin binds to **poly-L-proline motifs** in proteins like formins and Ena/VASP.
- These proteins nucleate and elongate filaments, and profilin delivers actin monomers directly to them.
- This creates a **targeted, efficient pipeline** of actin monomers into growing filaments.
