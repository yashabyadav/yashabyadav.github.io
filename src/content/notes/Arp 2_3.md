The Arp2/3 complex is thus a molecular machinery that provides the directionality, orientation, and large-scale architecture to the actin cytoskeleton that is necessary for its function.

What are SD1-SD4 domains of Arp2/3 complex?
|Subdomain|Location / Function|Structural role|
|---|---|---|
|**SD1**|N-terminal lobe|Contacts other actin subunits; part of the “barbed end” interface|
|**SD2**|Small domain, adjacent to SD1|Contributes to the nucleotide-binding cleft|
|**SD3**|Larger domain|Anchors the nucleotide pocket (along with SD2)|
|**SD4**|Large C-terminal domain|Contains the “back” of the molecule; key for domain rotation during flattening|
