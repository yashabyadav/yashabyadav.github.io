            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a PhD scholar at the Department of Physics at Lehigh University, where I focus on understanding 
              cellular mechanobiology through mathematical and computational modeling. My research explores 
              how cells generate and respond to mechanical forces, with recent work on actin comet tail motility 
              and the role of de novo nucleation of F-actin in cellular movement.
            </p>
            <p>

              I love my research because it requires me to use interdisciplinary approaches that combines physics, computational methods, and biological systems. This type of challenge keeps me motivated and excited about my work because if you know anything about me, it's that I cannot focus on one thing for too long! If I am stuck on physics problem, I'd rather swtich to coding a simulation or reading a biology paper to get my mind off things. 
            </p>
           <p>
              Other than research, my time here at Lehigh has been spent  as a teaching assistant for introductory physics courses and labs, helping students develop intuition for fundamental physics concepts. 
            </p>  
            <p>
              When I'm not vibe coding, I like to actually learn about Python concepts. Currently, I am learning how to make my code more "python-y". (Don't sleep on PEP y'all!!)
            </p>
            <p>
              I completed my Master's in Physics from IIT Jodhpur and my Bachelor's from the University of Delhi.
