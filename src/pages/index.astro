              <p class="lead">
                I am a PhD researcher in Physics at Lehigh University working on
                computational and mathematical models of cellular
                mechanobiology. My research focuses on how mechanical forces
                emerge from cytoskeletal dynamics, with recent work on actin
                comet tail motility and force generation driven by F-actin
                nucleation.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                I specialize in building mechanistic simulations that connect
                physical models to experimental observables. My work routinely
                involves numerical methods, stochastic simulations, data
                analysis, and visualization, with an emphasis on model clarity,
                reproducibility, and interpretability.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                I am comfortable working across theory, code, and data, and I
                enjoy translating complex physical ideas into efficient
                computational workflows. Most of my development is in Python and
                C++, supported by scripting, automation, and visualization tools
                tailored to research-scale problems.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                In parallel with research, I have taught introductory physics
                courses and laboratories, where I focus on building intuition
                and helping students become confident with quantitative
                reasoning.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                I earned my Master’s degree in Physics from IIT Jodhpur and my
                Bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Delhi,
                India.
